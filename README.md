# PDF Invoice Parser (PDF → CSV / Excel)

A Python utility that batch-processes invoice PDFs, extracts key fields (Invoice/Order ID, Date, Total Amount), normalizes values, and exports results to **CSV** and **Excel (.xlsx)**.

✅ Text-based PDF extraction (fast)  
✅ Batch processing (folder of PDFs)  
✅ Field extraction with regex rules  
✅ Normalized dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and amounts (rounded to 2 decimals)  
✅ CSV + Excel export  
✅ Per-file error handling (continues even if one PDF fails)
